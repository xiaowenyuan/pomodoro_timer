This is a simple Pomodoro timer created in React for [FreeCodeCamp's Front End Development Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock). Set the work and break time by either typing the requested time period in (the smallest permitted time is 1:00), or use the plus and minus buttons to increment and decrement the time period. The timer will loop and switch back between work and break as it runs out--a 'beep' will play when the timer runs out.
